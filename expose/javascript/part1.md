1. 'values added: 20' is printed by line 9
2. 'final result: 0' is printed by line 13
3. You should not use var because it is function-scoped meaning it can be accessed anywhere inside the function even outside of the block it's defined in. An example would be defining inside an if statement, but it is accessible outside the if statement in the function.
4. 'values added: 20' is printed by line 9
5. The code returns an error since let result is block-scoped meaning that since result is declared in the if statement, it does not exist outside of the if statement. Hence the attempt to access result outside of the if statements results in error.
6. The code returns an error because on line 7 the code tries reassigning result, however it is a const variable. A const variable is a constant variable that cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment. Hence line 9 does not run.
